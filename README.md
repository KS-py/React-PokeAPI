# React-PokeAPI

A React app created using the Vite tool.
The app fetches the Pokemon index from the PokeAPI website, and presents it in an enumerated format with pagination.

Some dependencies must be installed, check the package.json for these.
If you do not have these dependencies, run:
"npm install package.json" 

To run the app: 
Open a cmd window in the main project directory and type in:
"npm run dev"

To start the Vite React server and view the app on the port specified in your browser

Alternatively, you can create a new Vite React project, install the dependencies and then copy the contents of the src folder.

NodeJS, 
Axios (npm package),
React,
basic Vite project setup.
